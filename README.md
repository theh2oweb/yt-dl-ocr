# YT download and OCR

`yt-dl-ocr` is a tool to collect text strings that appears in YT videos.

First aim of this project is to help me learn linux commands by gathering the command lines used in a specific video on YT.

You can use it to extract all kind of texts by modifying the code (the reduceTexts method). My code may focus on other interests.

The process is (globally) as follow:
- Download specific video from its ID
- Extract characters using OCR

*Warning: Running OCR on each frame of a video is a long process*
